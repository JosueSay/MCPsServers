# MCP Local

The MCP is conceived as a **specialized server for managing FEL electronic invoices (SAT XMLs)**. Its purpose is to transform these documents into **stylized PDFs** that integrate a company’s visual identity (logo, colors, fonts), while also ensuring **automatic auditing of calculations** (subtotal, 12% VAT, total) and the **construction of the official verification URL/QR code**.

The workflow is designed as a **fully automated process with no manual intervention**: from receiving the FEL XML to obtaining a coherent, customizable PDF. This solves the rigidity of standard PDFs generated by the SAT, enabling delivery of documents that not only comply with fiscal requirements but also **reflect the company’s brand**.

## Main Features

* **Atomic validation:** `xml_path ->` reports inconsistencies (missing fields, totals, VAT).
* **Stylized PDF generation:** `xml_path, logo_path?, theme?, out? ->` produces a branded PDF.
* **Batch processing:** `dir_xml, out_dir ->` generates multiple PDFs and a *manifest* of results.

## Technologies

* **Python** as the core language.
* **ReportLab** for PDF composition (supports local TTF fonts like Montserrat or Roboto).
* **xml.etree / lxml** for parsing and validating FEL XMLs.
* **reportlab.graphics.barcode.qr / qrcode** for generating the verification QR code.

The design is **100% local**, with no reliance on external APIs, ensuring **privacy and reliability** in handling fiscal data.
